        <h4>Gingerbread Snoozy Christmas Branding</h4>
        <h5>Cinema 4D, Illustrator, Photoshop</h5>
        <p>As a marketing strategy for The Trade Groupâ€™s portable Snoozy structures, they decided they wanted to build a gingerbread house as a Snoozy. I designed the box using Cinema 4D using a base model Snoozy file provided which I altered to make it more festive. I designed each Snoozy in a different theme. Then I Photoshopped them onto a scenic Christmas scene. I also designed the instructions and handout in Illustrator. </p>

        <h4>AirClad XLive Passport</h4>
        <h5>Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator</h5>
        <p>The Trade Group asked me to design a passport for the XLive show in Las Vegas, 2017. Attendees would go to each AirClad exhibit and receive a stamp as they go. The AirClad series included six structures. The front of the passport compromised line art drawn by me of the units that were later printed in gold foil just like a passport Click here to view the PDF</p>

        <h5>InDesign, Illustrator</h5>
        <p>The Trade Group is a  full-service, event marketing and exhibit management resource that helps in any show or convention. I designed this concept to explain TTG (The Trade Group) in icons. The icons consisted of everyday things TTG used and made. The icons form a tree with a finishing touch of a person placing the TTG logo on the top.</p>

        <h4>Red Star Real Estate</h4>
        <h5>Photoshop, Illustrator</h5>
        <p>Red Star Real Estate is a company I found that did not have any branding done yet. I took the initiative and designed a modern logo for their establishment situated in New York. I wanted to use negative space to create another shape within the star to make it simple to understand at first glance. </p>

      <h5>Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator</h5>
      <p>Pronto Cafe is a hip, university-based coffee shop that offers not only baked goods and coffee, but also entertainment. The cafe is targeting college students from the ages of 18 years old to 24 years old. The aim was to create fun and clever designs such as the moustache, nerd glasses, and hat patterns to be used diverse on the various merchandise. I also used different terms for the cup size, roast, flavor and dessert to implement the college vibe further.</p>

    <h4>Chicagoly Winter Edition Persona Drawings</h4>
    <h5>Illustrator</h5>
    <p>For the Chicagoly Winter 2017 edition, an article on Chicagoan's perspective on the city was written. However, the head shots given weren't cohesive. The solution was to vectorize each headshot to look like rough drawings. By Using Adobe Illustrator and a brush, I vectorized portraits for the Chicagoly Magazine to give it a rough drawn look. The portraits were published in the Winter 2017 edition. I feel this project exhibits my talent in digital illustration.</p>

    <h4>Medication Package Design</h4>
    <h5>Photoshop, Illustrator</h5>
    <p>The challenge was to create a design for something intangible. I chose to make packaging for phobias I decided to go with a less illustrative design by imitating general drug store medication. Displayed below are designs for Arachnophobia (fear of spiders), Musophobia (fear of mice), and Galeophobia (fear of sharks).</p>
